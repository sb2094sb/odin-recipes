            <ol class="content">
                <li>Prepare seasoned sushi rice and then slice and julienne the vegetables.</li>
                <li>Prepare seasoned sushi rice and then slice and julienne the vegetables.Place one sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat rough side-up.* Add 1 cup sushi rice on the rough part of the nori. Spread it out as much as you can with a rice paddle. Then, get your fingertips wet with a little water and lightly spread out the rice to all of the edges except for the one furthest from you. You’ll want to stop ½-inch from that end so the nori can seal once rolled.</li>
                <li>Slightly off-center and close to you, place a few carrot strips, ¼ of the avocado slices, and a few pieces of cucumber. Sprinkle on some salt, if desired.</li>
                <li>Starting from the end by you, lift up the mat over the vegetables and begin rolling, pushing back in the filling as you go. Make sure to tighten up the roll for the best results.</li>
                <li>Once you’ve completely rolled up the sushi, wet your fingers and run it along the ½-inch piece of nori that was left uncovered. This will make the nori stick together and seal the roll. 
                    Repeat with the remaining nori and filling ingredients until you have 4 rolls.</li>
                <li>To cut the sushi: Run a sharp chef’s knife under cold water and cut 2-3 slices at a time. Repeat this until you have cut each roll into 8-10 pieces.</li>
                <li>Finish the avocado roll with a drizzle of sriracha mayo and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds, if you’d prefer. Serve with some wasabi, sushi ginger, and soy sauce on the side. Enjoy!</li>
